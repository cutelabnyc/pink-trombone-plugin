# Pink Trombone Plugin

https://dood.al/pinktrombone/

Hooray, it's a JUCE plugin port of the pink trombone. You'll need JUCE, obviously. From there just build and enjoy.

## Getting Started

It's a typical CMake situation. You'll get the JUCE submodule, then build in the usual CMake way.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
